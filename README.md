# [Acquire Project, Idaho State University, Spring 2020](https://github.com/Xingchengbo/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Acquire%20Project)

As a final group project, I created a digital version of the Acquire board game in Java. Acquire is a multi-player mergers and acquisitions themed board game. The object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains. Not only this project contains the main modules such as Board, Driver, Chain, and Tile, etc., but also a graphical user interface made with JavaFX. I provided the code and screenshots of the running game interface. As a team developer, I completed all the UI parts and code testing. Through this project, I have a deeper grasp of computer graphics technology.

# [Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Project, Idaho State University, Spring 2020](https://github.com/Xingchengbo/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Traveling%20Salesperson%20Problem%20(TSP))

The TSP problem consists of Given: a directed graph and a cost associated with each edge; Return: the lowest cost complete simple tour of the graph. This TSP project implemented a graphical user interface and multiple algorithms, including the Branch and bound, the Greedy, and the Hungarian, aimed to find the best solutions for the TSP in Python. In this project, the design of the graphical user interface took me the longest time. The project report contains an explanation of each algorithm, an empirical analysis of the results, and screenshots of the operation. As a group member, I completed the Hungarian algorithm, the graphical user interface, and the final project report.

# [Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Project, Idaho State University, Spring 2020](https://github.com/Xingchengbo/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Internet%20Relay%20Chat%20(IRC))

As a final project, I used the programming language C to implement broadcasting messages to several clients according to channels the client subscribed to. Not only did I implement multiple commands to support usersâ€™ experience, but I also built support for threaded file I/O including for logging and reading in and updating configuration files. In addition to the code, I also provided a detailed project description, a README file of how to run the code, and screenshots of the program running. The whole project was completed by myself. Through this project, I have a deeper grasp of Information and Communication Technology.

# [Monopoly Project, Idaho State University, Fall 2019](https://github.com/Xingchengbo/Creative-Portfolio/tree/main/Monopoly%20Project)

Idahack, a coding competition that students needed to come up with the coolest piece of software or application of circuitry that they could muster within a limited time as teamwork. In order to apply the game design I learned from the software engineering course into practice, I created a digital version of the Monopoly board game in Java as a group project. It contains seven main modules, such as Players, Board, and Game Engine, etc. This project has a graphical user interface, responding to both mouse and keyboard input, which attempts to mimic the play of the actual game. I showed all the operations of the game in a demo video. As the group leader, I completed the graphical user interface, Board, and MainGame, etc. [Monopoly Demo YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/66xGHN_pJ4o)

# Assistive Tableware Set, Henan University of Economics and Law, Spring 2017

In China, I joined Enactus, an international organization, which focuses on using business skills to solve social problems. My team created a set of specially designed assistive tableware for the elderly in nursing homes, which was more conducive to people with physical impairments. The tableware set includes a bowl with an inclined angle, a spoon with a curvature, a cup with increased friction at the bottom, and a chopstick with a link device at the end. As the team leader, I was responsible for the research of the entire project and participated in the main design of the product. This set of tableware was made in China a long time ago, and now the data has been lost, so I apologize for not being able to provide any graphics.
