# IRC Project
In this project, we will produce an IRC client and server according to 
the below standards. This project will be turned in over several deliverables.

We will produce an IRC client and server using several technologies that 
we will be learning about through the semester. These client and server programs
will communicate with each other to broadcast messages to several clients
according to channels the client has subscribed to. The requirements and protocol
are inï¬‚uenced by RFC 1459 - Internet Relay Chat Protocol.
